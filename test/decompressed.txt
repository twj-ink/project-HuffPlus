hello, Huff-Plus~~

This is a test file for compression algorithms. 
Compression algorithms are used to reduce the size of files by eliminating redundancy in the data. 
In this test, we will use this file to see how well different compression methods perform. 
Compression can be lossless, meaning that the original data can be perfectly restored, or lossy, where some data is lost in the process. 
The goal of this test is to demonstrate how compression algorithms like Huffman coding can reduce the size of a file.
